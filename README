In this project I just tried a different method of coding a command engine using python code that is
parsed in javascript. Unfortunately I quit this due to the fact, that transcrpyt offers currently no
way of using symbolic math (sympy is not supported so far).


With transcrypt python you can parse python to javascript and use that in your html browser!
For howto see the init.py in this folder!

## Install:
numscrypt and typescrypt both install!
pip install plotly
in your folder:

## Compile:
transcrypt -b -c -m hello.py

Overloading params and trying to use eval function also does not work as I wanted it:
